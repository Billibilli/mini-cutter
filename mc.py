# Minni-cutter v0.1 - BETA
# By Yigao Shao
#
# Usage: python mc.py [PATH]
# Example: python mc.py /home/project
# 
# This is a script to clean up a website folder. 
# WARNING: ALWAYS back up your directory before performing the cleaning!
#          The safety of the script is not throughoutly verified.
#
# Idea: Delete unesscesary files by anlyzing the dependencies to index.*.
# 1) It first recurssively acquire all the file names inside PATH.
# 2) Next it would find a file in PATH begins with "index" and read it, 
#    looking for patterns matching the acquired file names. If it find some, then 
#    it will go to these files and check accordingly.
# 3) Recurssion  
# 4) File-to-be-deleted set is the complement.So just delete the remaining files in the set. 
# 5) Recursively delete the empty folders.
#
# Notice:
# 1) To prevent cyclic refenrencing, it deletes the traversed entry in the 
#    global file  storage after one trail of recurssion. 
# 2) To prevent repeated referencing, dictionary data structure are used extensively  
#
# Statics:
#      Takes 2 mins go through 1800 files and reserve 900 files.
#
# Drawbacks:
#      1) There are no built-in parser so it couldn't distinguish between comments and codes.

# Setting, program won't search for dependencies with extensions matching the patterns inside non_dig_type files. 
# A possible bug exists for dependencies of inside compiled executables.  
non_dig_type=['.png','.gif','.swf','.ico','.jpg']

#----To be implemented feature in the futre
# Enable rich configuration to define the protect_rule 
#      1) If a key exists and content is not empty,then follow the rules. 
#      2) If the key exists and the content is empty, then default to protect EVERY files
#               a) type:[] means protect EVERY files so the script does nothing. 
#               b) filename:[] means protect EVERY files so the script does nothing. Same to a) 
#               c) directory:[] means protect EVERY directory even they are empty. 
#      3) If a key doesn't exist, then default behavior is to reserve minimal necessary files
#
# Example:
# protect_rule={'type':['.sh','.md','.lic','.sql','.bat','.TXT',''],'filename':['LICENSE.lic'],'directory':[phpadmin]}
